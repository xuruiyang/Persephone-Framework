# Persephone-Framework
This is the codebase submitted in supplementary to my thesis work (URL TBD).

Use python main.py to run the code under each project.

Change configurations in main.py for different hyperparameters.

Change the formula definition in ./persephone/PersephoneGame.py for different games.
