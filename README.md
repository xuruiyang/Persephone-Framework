# Persephone-Framework
This is the codebase submitted in supplementary to my thesis work (URL TBD).

Use python run.py [Problem Definition File] to run the code under each project.

For example:

python run.py Nim.txt

Change configurations in run.py for different hyperparameters.

For QSAT Change QDIMACS file in .\qsat\generated for different instances.

For Model-Check Change the TS definition in ./ts/TransitionSystem.py for different instances and also conf.py file for user configuration.
